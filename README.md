<h2> Project Motivation </h2>
The city of Charlotte has, like many cities, made large volumes of data open to the public in an online repository. This open data provides substantial potential for the city to benefit from knowledge discovery and insights generated by members of the public, such as ourselves. Service requests dialed to 311 represent a large opportunity to delve into the needs of the population and potentially extract useful trends that could allow the city to improve its service to its citizens. The goal of this project is to explore and uncover exactly those trends in the hope that the knowledge we discover may be used by the city to improve the quality of life of our families, friends, and neighbors.
<h2> Research Question(s) </h2>
Do different areas within the city experience higher recurrence of any type of request, and do those areas correlate with red-line districts or other known demographic or socioeconomic profiles?
<h2> Data Resources </h2>
Data was retrieved from the City of Charlotte's 
<a href="https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/charlotte::service-requests-311/about"> Open Data Portal </a> 
on 30 September, 2021. The data set is a collection of the public records requests received by the City of Charlotte from 2017 through March, 2020. It contains multiple descriptive fields related to service request entry, including request type, location (street, lat/long, etc.), date, city department responsible for the request, and point of entry.

<h2> Future Work </h2>
<h3> Possible future work may include:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Explore correlations between weather and 311 service requests</li>
  <li>Predict high call volume days or periods to alleviate workload and wait time concerns</li>
  <li>Explore correlations between location and specific service requests' response times</li>
</ol>
