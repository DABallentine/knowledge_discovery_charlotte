<h2> Project Motivation </h2>
Similar to any other large organization these days, the city of Charlotte has far more data sitting around than they have people who know what to do with it to generate actionable insights. Service requests dialed to 311 represent a large opportunity to delve into the needs of the population and potentially extract useful trends that could allow the city to improve its service to its citizens. The goal of this project is to explore and uncover exactly those trends in the hope that the knowledge we discover may be used by the city to improve the quality of life of our families, friends, and neighbors.
<h2> Research Question(s) </h2>
What factors influence the volume, frequency, and type of 311 service calls to the city of Charlotte, NC, and what is the nature of those influential relationships?
<h2> Data Resources </h2>
Data was retrieved from the City of Charlotte's 
<a href="https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/charlotte::service-requests-311/about"> Open Data Portal </a> 
on 30 September, 2021. The data set is a collection of the public records requests received by the City of Charlotte from 2017 through March, 2020. It contains multiple descriptive fields related to service request entry, including request type, location (street, lat/long, etc.), date, city department responsible for the request, and point of entry.

<h2>Future Work </h2>
<h3> Possible future work may include:</h3>
<ol><li>Predicting crime rates by area base on 311 service requests</li>
  <li>Predicting accidents based on pothole reports</li>
  <li>Explore correlations between weather and 311 service requests</li>
  <li>Predict high call volume days or periods to alleviate workload and wait time concerns</li>
  <li>Explore correlations between location and specific service requests' response times</li>
</ol>
