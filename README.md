## Project Motivation 
The city of Charlotte has, like many cities, made large volumes of data open to the public in an online repository. This open data provides substantial potential for the city to benefit from knowledge discovery and insights generated by members of the public, such as ourselves. Service requests dialed to 311 represent a large opportunity to delve into the needs of the population and potentially extract useful trends that could allow the city to improve its service to its citizens. The goal of this project is to explore and uncover exactly those trends in the hope that the knowledge we discover may be used by the city to improve the quality of life of our families, friends, and neighbors.


## Research Question(s) 
Do different areas within the city of Charlotte experience higher recurrence of any
type of 311 service request than other areas, and do those areas correlate with
red-line districts or other known demographic or socioeconomic profiles?

## Data Resources 
Data was retrieved from the City of Charlotte's [Open Data Portal](https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/charlotte::service-requests-311/about) on 30 September, 2021. The data set is a collection of the public records requestsreceived by the City of Charlotte from 2017 through March, 2020. It contains multiple descriptive fields related to service request entry, including request type, location (street, lat/long, etc.), date, city department responsible for the request, and point of entry.

## Python libraries to install
Before running any of the Jupyter notebooks mentioned in the repository, the below libraries need to be installed in the local machine using Anaconda:

```
    pip install missingno
    pip install geopandas
    pip install contextily
```

## Data Preprocessing 
## Data Understanding and Exploration 
## Data Preparation for Modeling 
## Modeling 
## Evaluation 
## Results 
## Future Work 
### Possible future work may include:
1.  Explore correlations between weather and 311 service requests
2.  Predict high call volume days or periods to alleviate workload and wait time concerns
3.  Explore correlations between location and specific service requests' response times
